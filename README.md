# ETL-World-Happiness

## Overview
The World Happiness project was created to implement the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using a data pipeline through web scraping. The extracted data includes national happiness rankings along with the continent of each country, which is then transformed and loaded into PostgreSQL. The following is the website that will be scraped:
* https://kids.kiddle.co/List_of_countries_by_continents
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:
1. Docker & Docker Compose: To set up the Airflow and PostgreSQL services.
2. Python 3.7+: For the ETL scripts.
3. Apache Airflow: To manage and schedule the ETL pipeline.
4. Pandas Library: For data transformation.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Installation & Configuration
Clone the project repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/farhanriyandi/ETL-World-Happiness.git
cd <local-project-directory>
```
### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Before starting the project, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies in your local project directory:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```
### 3. Install all dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Build and Start the Docker Containers
Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` to set up Airflow and PostgreSQL:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
### 5. Postgres connection configuration

### 6. Airflow connection configuration
* open `localhost:8089` to access Airflow.
```
Username: airflow
Password: airflow
```
* setup connection to postgresql
1. select admin menu > connections in the Airflow UI
2. Click on the 'Create' button to add a new connection.
3. Enter the following details as shown in the image below:

`Note` maybe in your host section it can be different in the picture. you can find out your host by opening the command prompt, then type:
```
docker ps
docker exec -it <your_postgres_container_id> bash
```
then type:
`hostname -I`

Then your host will appear, and fill in the host with your own host.

### 7. Running Dag
Select the `DAGs menu > etl_countries_happiness` and trigger the DAG.
